# Rigs of Rods - Blender addon

This project intends to expand recently created (and excellent) [Ulteq's import/export scripts](https://github.com/RigsOfRods/rigs-of-rods/tree/master/tools/blender) and add interactive editing capabilities.

Also, RoR ecosystem contains a solid amount of discontinued Python code, which deserves to be studied and re-used:
 * [RoRToolkit](https://github.com/only-a-ptr/ror-toolkit) - Standalone wxPython + OGRE 1.8 application focused on editing terrain (legacy .terrn format) but also capable of editing vehicles
 * [BlenderPortable 2.49 with plugins](https://archives.rigsofrods.net/old-forum-mybb/thread-126.html) - Vehicle parsing + editing capabilities
